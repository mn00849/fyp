Question 5 answer:
Part a: 40 missing from. Part b: frequency scale. Part c: Incorrect. Part d: point (50, 5). .
Mark Scheme for question: Two different statements
Acceptable
eg (50, 5) / the last point is incorrect
the last point should be at (45,5)
the last point plotted was placed incorrectly
for his last point he has plotted by the end of the data and for the rest he has plotted by the
middle
he did not use the midpoint, he used 50 instead of 45
40 missing (from vertical axis)
vertical scale is not linear
the frequency doesn’t increase in the same intervals
the vertical axis is not right
Not acceptable
eg the last point should be at (40, 5)
bottom of the polygon should be connected
he didn’t start the graph at the origin
he did not draw a polygon
he has plotted the first 4 points at midpoint
One acceptable statement).

Question 9 (a)
(b) answer:
Part a: 1060. Part b: reason. .

for correct use of rules of indices leading as far as √10120 or
10120
cao
for correct reasoning
Acceptable examples
eg should do 50 × 2 (not 50²)
because (1250)2 = 12100
because when you have a power inside and outside the bracket you times them
because (𝑎𝑏)𝑐 = 𝑎𝑏𝑐 (not 𝑎𝑏𝑐 )
Not acceptable examples
because you need to multiply everything in the brackets by 2
because he should have squared 12 as well
you add the powers instead of timesing.
