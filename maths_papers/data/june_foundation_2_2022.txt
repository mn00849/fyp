answer in the range 18.7 to 19.5
for a valid statement relating to scale factor for area,
Acceptable examples
there are 10000 (cm2) in 1 (m2)
because 1 m2 is the same as 100 × 100 = 10000 cm2
there are 2 side lengths that change from 1 m to 100 cm
300 ÷ 3 is 100 should use 1002
300 ÷ 100 ÷ 100 = 0.03
3 × 100 × 100 = 30000
Because it's area not length.
Because it’s in m2 not just metres
He hasn’t taken the squared sign into account
Not acceptable examples
there are 1000 cm in 1 m
Callum is correct because …….
300 ÷ 3 is 100
32 = 9
300 × 300 = 90000
