Question 8 (a)
(b) answer:
Part a: 28 33. Part b: Explanation. .
Mark Scheme for question: cao
for explanation
Acceptable examples
all terms end in 3 or 8
there are no terms that end in 0
50 does not end in 3 or 8
48 and 53 are both in the sequence (could be shown)
48 is in the sequence and 50 is 2 more
5n‒2=50 so n is not a whole number.
if it started at 0 then it would but it starts at 3 so it never will
or shows sequence continuing up to and beyond 50
Not acceptable examples
adding 5 each time will not lead to 50 (insufficient)
it goes past 50
the closest number to 50 is 48.
